#Shion (A Face Verification Server)

Shion is my conception project in Sup√©lec. I want to show a prototype mechanism for face recognition on the website.

I use **Opencv** for realising face recognition and use sails.js for constructing the server. 

Before finishing it, I study @irlnathan/activityoverlord for how to construct a web application with sails.js and the logic of the face recognition from @charlesmwang/facerec-server-node-sails  

#Install
